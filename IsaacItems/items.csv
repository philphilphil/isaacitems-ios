The recharging of the item only triggers so long as there are enemies present in the room in any fashion.

As this tears upgrade directly affects tear delay, it allows Isaac's tear rate to go over the maximum rate of fire. *Holding the fire buttons causes tears to hover in midair. When released, the tears will all shoot in the direction they were originally fired. *If the fire buttons are not released, the tears will fire on their own after a while.;*Gravitational effects, such as Mega Fatty's inhalation or a Gaping Maw will pull floating tears toward them. *The Range attribute only affects the lifespan of the tears after they have been released. *Hovering tears can damage monsters like Knights or Mask Of Infamy from the front, even if they don't have the piercing effect.

The player can control where the target is using the arrow keys.*After approximately 2 seconds, a large missile will land on the red marker. The missile acts like a large bomb explosion dealing 20 times the character's damage (the same as Epic Fetus).;
ItemRebirth;A Dollar;18;collectibles_018;dollar, green, bill;Upon picking up A Dollar the player's penny count will be set to 99, the maximum possible amount of money.;Picking this item up will automatically unlock Cain.*Multiple Dollars can be dropped in the same run by different slot machines.
ItemRebirth;Dr. Fetus;52;collectibles_052;glass, fetus;Tears are replaced with bombs that explode approximately one second after being fired.*Each bomb deals 3 times the character's normal tear damage.;*Dr. Fetus overrides multiple tear effect items but benefit from some (but not all) bomb-enhancing effects like Mr. Mega.*In Afterbirth, many more synergies have been added. This page has to be updated for that.
ItemRebirth;Dry Baby;265;collectibles_265;grey baby;Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and blocks enemy projectiles. Upon blocking a shot it has a chance of triggering The Necronomicon effect, dealing 40 damage to all enemies in the room.;*The Necronomicon effect can occur multiple times in the same room.*It can be used to block multiple shots if positioned correctly.*It sometimes layers itself above Isaac's Heart, protecting it from nearly all projectile damage.
ItemRebirth;E. Coli;236;collectibles_236;sperm red;Enemies that touch Isaac are turned into Poop.;If you touch the middle section of a Grub with E Coli, it will then split and become two heads (rather than destroying and spawning Maggots)
ItemRebirth;Epic Fetus;168;collectibles_168;glas fetus;Isaac's tears are replaced with guided missiles, like those used by the Doctor's Remote.*Missiles deal 20 times Isaac's damage.;Missiles benefit from most bomb-enhancing effects.*Epic Fetus overrides most items in the game and has the highest priority of all of them, over Brimstone and Mom's Knife.
ItemRebirth;Eve's Mascara;310;collectibles_310;mascara, black;*2x Damage multiplier*-0.5 Shot Speed. (Minimum Shot Speed is 0.6)*0.5x Tears multiplier. The multiplier doesn't set the value once, but instead is permanently applied (i.e. Isaac's Tear value will always be halved).;Soy Milk and Monstro's Lung directly change the Tears stat, even after the calculation of Eve's Mascara. This means these two are the only items in the game that can change the fixed reduction of tears Eve's Mascara creates.
ItemRebirth;Experimental Treatment;240;collectibles_240;needle, yellow;Randomly increases and decreases some of the character's stats. There will always be at least one stat increase and one decrease and the same stats can be increased/decreased multiple times.;Despite the item's description, the item does not actually increase all stats or shuffle them.
ItemRebirth;Fanny pack;204;collectibles_204;brown, belt, bag;Grants a chance to drop a random pickup whenever Isaac takes damage.;
ItemRebirth;Fate;179;collectibles_179;blue, lightblue;Grants flight and one Eternal Heart.;
ItemRebirth;Fire Mind;257;collectibles_257;tear, fire, black;Tears ignite on hit.*Ignited enemies take either 4 or 6 damage over time.*Tears have a chance to explode on hit, leaving behind fire.*Explosions deal 22 damage plus double Isaac's current tear damage;*The explosion effect chance depends on the Luck stat, and goes up to 100% at 13 Luck.*The explosion will hurt Isaac, but the flame will only harm enemies, with the exception of Hoppers who will transform into Flaming Hoppers.
ItemRebirth;FLUSH!;291;collectibles_291;grey, flush;*Turns all non-boss enemies into poop.*Floods the whole room with water (Same effect as seen in the Flooded Caves).*Flushes all poop related enemies away including Dingle, Dangle, and Brownie.;The enemies turned into poop are somewhat still treated like normal enemies: the sound of killing an enemy plays when the poop is destroyed, and items will also behave like the poop was a normal enemy. (Example: BBF will explode if it comes into contact with an enemy turned into poop.)
ItemRebirth;Forever Alone;128;collectibles_128;fly, blue;*Spawns a blue attack fly orbital that orbits a long distance from Isaac and deals contact damage to enemies.*The fly deals 2 damage per tick.*This item belongs to the Lord of the Flies set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Lord of the Flies.;
ItemRebirth;Forget Me Now;127;collectibles_127;pill, purple;*Upon activation this item is consumed and will vanish from Isaac's inventory.*Upon activation the current floor will be completely re-generated.*Isaac will restart the level just as if he had entered a new floor.;*The re-generated floor will count as the same floor number as the one Isaac used Forget Me Now in.*Any items earned prior to using the re-generation effect will still remain in Isaac's inventory.*If used on the Necropolis II or Depths II after beating Mom, you can get both The Negative and The Polaroid in one run. Additionally, two Boss Rushes can be entered as long as the total playtime of the run stays under 20 minutes.*If used on The Chest or Dark Room when the Door to Mega Satan has been opened, the Golden key will not re-open the door and you will be unable to fight him.*If used on an XL floor, the merged chapter will be re-generated as two seperate floors instead.
ItemRebirth;The Gamekid;93;collectibles_093;gameboy, grey;Upon use turns the character into a PacMan-like creature for six seconds and provides the following effects:*Grants invulnerability and increased speed.*Inflicts fear on all enemies.*Removes ability to shoot tears and instead dealing contact damage to enemies.*Replenishes half a red heart for every two enemies killed.;*The invulnerability effect negates all forms of damage, including health loss from Blood Donation Machines and Devil Beggars.*Does not prevent heart container loss from Health Down Pills or Devil Room deals.
ItemRebirth;Gemini;318;collectibles_318;blue;Gives Isaac a conjoined familiar, much like Gemini's small twin, Suture. It attacks only through short-ranged contact damage.;
ItemRebirth;Ghost Baby;163;collectibles_163;ghost, white;Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and fires spectral tears that deal 3.5 damage each.;Despite having spectral tears, It's unable to shoot when floating over an obstacle.
ItemRebirth;Gimpy;225;collectibles_225;face, grey;Whenever Isaac takes damage, there is a chance that a Soul Heart or a Black Heart might spawn.*Enemies have a chance to drop half of a red heart after being killed.;Gimpy's Soul Heart drop chance depends on the Luck stat, and goes up to 50% at 22 Luck.
ItemRebirth;Gnawed Leaf;210;collectibles_210;green;*Upon pickup, Isaac gets a small brown ringtail.*After standing still and not pressing the move or attack buttons for one second, Isaac will turn into an invincible statue.*Using bombs and active items will remove the invincibility state as well.;
ItemRebirth;Goat Head;215;collectibles_215;goat head brown;A Devil Room / Angel Room Door will always spawn after every boss fight, excluding the first floor and floors after Utero II/Womb II.;Accepting a deal with the devil will prevent any Angel Rooms from appearing, meaning that Isaac needs to acquire the Goat Head in a Curse Room, Golden Chest, Red Chest or with Credit Card in order to force Angel Rooms to appear.*Even if taken after a boss is killed, Goat Head will force a Devil / Angel Room Door to spawn on that floor. The door will always stay opened.*Goat Head and The Book Of Belial are the only items that will ensure 
ItemRebirth;GodHead;331;collectibles_331;eye;*0.5 Damage.*-0.3 Tears.*+1.2 Range.*-30% Shot Speed.*+0.8 Shot Height.*Grants homing tears.*Tears gain a damaging aura.;
ItemRebirth;Growth Hormones;70;collectibles_070;needle, purple;*+1 Damage*+0.4 Speed;
ItemRebirth;Guardian Angel;112;collectibles_112;angle, wings;Spawns an orbital familiar that blocks enemy projectiles and deals contact damage to *enemies.*Increases the speed of all orbital familiars.;The increased orbital speed improves odds of being protected from enemy projectiles.
ItemRebirth;The Guillotine;206;collectibles_206;knife, silver;*+1.0 Damage up.*-1 Tear delay. As this tears upgrade directly affects tear delay, it allows Isaac's tear rate to go over the maximum rate of fire.*Isaac's head rotates around his body and can be used to inflict damage similar to A Cube of Meat. Blocking tears with Isaac's head does not damage Isaac. His tears still originate from his head, so the line of fire is no longer constant while standing still.;
ItemRebirth;Guppy's Collar;212;collectibles_212;head collar;*Isaac has a permanent 50% chance to resurrect on death.*Resurrection leaves Isaac at half a red heart.*Guppy's Collar takes priority over all other resurrection items when activated.*This item belongs to the Guppy set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Guppy.;
ItemRebirth;Guppy's Hairball;187;collectibles_187;hair, brown;*Spawns a hair ball that loosely follows behind Isaac and can be swung like a flail, dealing contact damage to enemies and blocking projectiles.*The ball grows bigger by killing enemies, which increases its damage.*The size of the ball resets upon entering a new floor.*This item belongs to the Guppy set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Guppy.;"The function and flavor text of this item might be a reference to the idioms ""no room to swing a cat"" or ""can't swing a dead cat without hitting...""."
ItemRebirth;Guppy's Head;145;collectibles_145;head, cat;Spawns 2-4 Blue Flies.;*Each blue fly deals double Isaac's damage.*This item belongs to the Guppy set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Guppy.*In Challenge #8 (Cat Got Your Tongue), Isaac starts with this item.
ItemRebirth;Guppy's Paw;133;collectibles_133;cat, paw;*Converts one Heart Container to three Soul Hearts.*This item belongs to the Guppy set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Guppy.;
ItemRebirth;Guppy's Tail;134;collectibles_134;cat, tail;*Grants a 1/3 chance of replacing a pickup with a normal chest or gold chest, but also a 1/3 chance to replace it with nothing at all.*This item belongs to the Guppy set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Guppy.;In Challenge #8 (Cat Got Your Tongue), you start with this item.
ItemRebirth;Habit;156;collectibles_156;head, black;When Isaac is hit, his active item gains 1 room's worth of charge.;*Book Of Revelations - Reduced damage to some degree due to getting a 6th of a charge every hit.*Yum Heart - With the 9 Volt, Isaac could potentially become invincible on early floors or with The Wafer. Also permits free use of Blood Donation Machine.*Placenta & Book Of Revelations - If the player is patient enough, they can be used to generate the maximum amount of spirit hearts without losing anything.
ItemRebirth;The Halo;101;collectibles_101;head, gold;*+1 Heart Container*+0.3 Damage*+0.2 Tears*+0.25 Range*+0.3 Speed*+0.5 Tear Height;
ItemRebirth;Halo of Flies;10;collectibles_010;fly;*Spawns two pretty fly familiars that block enemy shots.*This item belongs to the Lord of the Flies set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Lord of the Flies.;Orbital flies can also be obtained by other means, such as Slot Machines and Pretty Fly pills.
ItemRebirth;Harlequin Baby;167;collectibles_167;baby fly;Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and fires two tears at once in a V-pattern which deal 4 damage each;
ItemRebirth;Head of Krampus;293;collectibles_293;dog;Fires a powerful Brimstone beam in four cardinal directions.*Has a chance to rotate all beams around the player 90 degrees, similar to Krampus's second Brimstone attack.;The power of the beams can One-Hit Kill Mom's Heart/It Lives if the item is used very close to the *boss.*Damaging enemies with the effect of this item as Guppy will spawn multiple Blue Flies.
ItemRebirth;Headless Baby;269;collectibles_269;corpse, blood;Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around, leaving a trail of red creep that damages enemies.;
ItemRebirth;Hive Mind;248;collectibles_248;fly, blue;*Increases the size of blue spiders and blue flies.*Doubles the damage dealt by blue spiders and blue flies.*This item belongs to the Lord of the Flies set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Lord of the Flies.;
ItemRebirth;Holy Grail;184;collectibles_184;gold;Grants flight and one heart container.;
ItemRebirth;Holy Mantle;313;collectibles_313;cross, blue;*Protects Isaac from damage by blocking one hit.*Shield effect recharges the next room.;*Holy Mantle won't be active when initially spawning on a floor in the spawn room. For example: the damage caused by walking into a Curse Room adjacent to spawn is not negated. Walking into another room and coming back to spawn resets the Holy Mantle and allows to safely enter said Curse Room.*As the shield gets restored whenever another room is entered, Isaac can enter and leave Curse Rooms without taking damage.*Unlike every other protective effect like shield or invulnerability, Holy Mantle does not prevent damage from Blood Donation Machines, Devil Beggars and Blood Rights. This is probably done to avoid exploiting them, given the infinitely rechargeable effect of the Holy Mantle.*Damage from Sacrifice Room spikes can be blocked by Holy Mantle, but a chest will not spawn unless Isaac actually takes damage.*Bad Trip will not damage the player when protected by Holy Mantle*The blocked hit does not count as damage taken for related achievements and will not trigger items that activate upon taking damage like Dead Bird.
ItemRebirth;Holy Water;178;collectibles_178;cross, blue;*Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac. If Isaac takes damage, it will shatter and create a blue pool of damaging water similar to the usable item Lemon Mishap.*After breaking, Holy Water will reappear in the next room.;
ItemRebirth;Hot Bombs;256;collectibles_256;bomb, fire;*Isaac gains +5 bombs on pickup.*Placed bombs will leave behind fire that damages enemies on contact before disappearing.*Fire from a Hot Bomb doesn't damage Isaac.;
ItemRebirth;The Hourglass;66;collectibles_066;timeglass;All enemies in the room are slowed for approximately 8 seconds.;
ItemRebirth;How To Jump;282;collectibles_282;book, mario, jump;*Upon use, Isaac jumps in the direction he is currently moving. The distance of the jump depends on how fast Isaac was moving when the item was activated. Jumping allows Isaac to travel over obstacles such as rocks, pits, and spikes.*While mid-jump, enemies, enemy shots, bombs, and spikes cannot damage Isaac. Isaac cannot interact with pickups or chests mid-jump.;*If Isaac has flight, Isaac dashes instead of jumping.*If Isaac has flight, and is flying above a ravine area, the dash distance will be next to none.*The item can be used to jump over the pillars of light spawned by Isaac (Boss).
ItemRebirth;Humbleing Bundle;203;collectibles_203;map, brown;*Gives one extra pickup (1+1 version) of red hearts, pennies, bombs and keys.*Does not work with soul hearts, black hearts, half red hearts, nickels, dimes, or drops from The Book Of Sin.;
ItemRebirth;Infamy;242;collectibles_242;mask, face, purple;Adds a high chance to block projectiles hitting Isaac from any direction. When effectively blocking a projectile, Isaac will briefly flash blue.;
ItemRebirth;Infestation;148;collectibles_148;worm, brown;*1-3 Blue Flies randomly spawn whenever Isaac takes damage.*This item belongs to the Lord of the Flies set. Collecting three items from the set will transform Isaac into Lord of the Flies.;
ItemRebirth;Infestation 2;234;collectibles_234;spider, brown;Grants an infestation shot that spawns an allied blue spider from each enemy killed.;*Enemies do not spawn spiders when killed by anything other than Isaac (environmental hazards, charmed enemies, etc).*Enemies do not spawn spiders when killed by blue spiders.*Blue flies can also spawn spiders.*Enemies killed by familiars will spawn blue spiders.
ItemRebirth;The Inner Eye;2;collectibles_002;eye, white;*Grants a triple shot*Tears down: (Delay * 2.1) + 3;
ItemRebirth;Ipecac;149;collectibles_149;bottle, brown;*Replaces tears with explosive and poisoning projectiles fired in an arc.*Tears down - (Delay * 2) + 10*+13 Shot Height;
ItemRebirth;Iron Bar;201;collectibles_201;metal bar silver;*+0.3 Damage.*Adds a chance to shoot concussive tears, causing enemies to walk around randomly.;Concussive tear effect depends on the Luck stat, and goes up to 100% at 27 Luck.
ItemRebirth;Isaac's Heart;276;collectibles_276;heart red;*Isaac's body becomes immune to all damage.*A heart familiar appears and closely follows Isaac. If the heart is hurt, Isaac is hurt.*Enemies now target the heart instead of Isaac. Eyes and other similar enemies, however, will still target Isaac.;*Items that activate on contact with enemies retain their ability, allowing Isaac to use them without suffering collision damage.*Isaac can use Blood Banks and Demon Beggars without taking damage.*With Afterbirth, Demon Beggars and Blood Banks deal damage to Isaac*Curse Rooms don't deal damage when entered.*Even if Isaac himself can't fly, the heart will hover over ground hazards, making Isaac immune to all damaging creep and spikes. However, Sacrifice Room's spikes can still damage it.*Picking up a non-orbital familiar will cause either Isaac's Heart or the other familiar to be layered over the other's sprite. This is due to the heart not taking up the spot that the other familiar follows in.*Enemy Brimstone shots (such as from The Bloat) will not deal any damage to the heart.*Additional players gain the immunity effect without spawning additional hearts.
ItemRebirth;Isaac's Tears;323;collectibles_323;glass water blue;*Each tear shot by the player increases item charge by one.*Upon use, fires 8 tears around the player, which retain the damage, shot speed, and most special effects of the player's tears.;Tammy's Head has an effect similar to Isaac's Tears, but Isaac's Tears will not benefit from tear-replacing items like Brimstone.
ItemRebirth;IV Bag;135;collectibles_135;blood bag;When activated, causes Isaac to lose half a heart (or a full heart in The Womb and beyond) while spawning 1-3 coins;*This effect is counted as inflicted damage for the purpose of items that spawn pickups upon damage, such as Gimpy or Fanny Pack, but does not count against the chance of encountering the Devil Room.*Invulnerability will not prevent Isaac from losing hearts.
ItemRebirth;The Jar;290;collectibles_290;brown jar;Isaac can store up to 4 extra red hearts in the jar if there are no remaining empty Heart *Containers.*When used, all hearts in the jar are dropped on the floor, rather than directly consuming them.;*Soul Hearts and Black Hearts cannot be stored.*If used in a Black Heart or Eternal Heart-containing Super Secret Room it will spawn those types of hearts instead.*If a whole red heart is picked up and Isaac only heals half a heart container, the other half is placed in the jar indicated by the jar number increasing by one. Despite the jar indicating that it picked up a whole red heart in this fashion, it will only drop half a red heart on use.*If a half red heart is picked up and placed in the jar the total heart number for the jar increases as though it collected a whole heart. Upon use however, the half heart will not drop. If two half hearts are picked up and placed in the jar, they will count as one whole red heart and drop upon activation as normal.
ItemRebirth;Jesus Juice;197;collectibles_197;juice purple bag;*+0.5 Damage up.*+0.25 Range up.*+0.5 Tear height.;
ItemRebirth;Judas' Shadow;311;collectibles_311;shadow black;*Grants an extra life.*Upon death, Isaac resurrects as Black Judas.*Black Judas has a damage multiplier of 2.00 and a base speed of 1.1.;*Beating bosses as Black Judas will give Completion Marks for Judas and will unlock the associated items and achievements.*Because Black Judas counts as a unique character, this means that all character-specific qualities are replaced with those of Black Judas's upon death. For example, if the Blue Baby dies and respawns as Black Judas, he will be able to pick up red heart containers. If Azazel dies and respawns as Black Judas, his short ranged Brimstone will be removed, along with his flying abilities.
ItemRebirth;Juicy Sack;266;collectibles_266;silver;*A familiar that follows behind Isaac. It drips a trail of creep that slows enemies.*Spawns 1-2 Blue Spiders after every room.;
ItemRebirth;Kamikaze;40;collectibles_040;red, bomb;Upon activation, causes an explosion in the same place as Isaac, damaging him and all monsters caught in the blast.;
ItemRebirth;Key Piece #1;238;collectibles_238;key gold;Combined with Key Piece 2, unlocks the golden gate in the starting room of The Chest and Dark Room to fight Mega Satan.;*The Golden Gate can alternatively be opened using Dad's Key.*This item, along with Key Piece 2, can be rerolled into any item from the Angel Room pool.*Unlocking the Golden Gate with the combined key pieces and then going to the I AM ERROR room will waste the key, which will not respawn.
ItemRebirth;Key Piece #2;239;collectibles_239;key gold;Combined with Key Piece 1, unlocks the golden gate in the starting room of The Chest and Dark Room to fight Mega Satan.;*The Golden Gate can alternatively be opened using Dad's Key.*This item, along with Key Piece 1, can be rerolled into any item from the Angel Room pool.*Unlocking the Golden Gate with the combined key pieces and then going to the I AM ERROR room will waste the key, which will not respawn.
ItemRebirth;The Ladder;60;collectibles_060;wood ladder;Allows Isaac to walk across gaps one square across by automatically placing a ladder between the two walkable sections. Enemies can not walk over the ladder.;
ItemRebirth;Lazarus' Rags;332;collectibles_332;rag blood;Grants an extra life and upon death respawns the character as Revived Lazarus. Unlike other items that cause the player to respawn, this item revives the player on the spot, as opposed to the previous room.;
ItemRebirth;Leo;302;collectibles_302;blue;Isaac can break obstacles by walking into them.;*Walking into bomb rocks will cause them to explode.*Mushrooms may hurt Isaac with a poison cloud if walked into.*Polyps may hurt Isaac with blood shots or red creep if walked into.*Flight does not prevent the effect from occurring.*Holes in the ground can be filled if Isaac walks into adjacent rocks from the right direction, similar to bombs.*TNT Barrels will not be destroyed or explode on contact.
ItemRebirth;Latch Key;343;collectibles_343;key;*+1 Luck*Gain 1 soul heart*Spawns 2 keys.;There is a golden key gets spawned instead of regular keys.
ItemRebirth;Leech;270;collectibles_270;grey worm;*Upon pickup, spawns a crawling Leech that follows Isaac. If an enemy comes near, the Leech will attack and chase it, dealing 1.5 damage per tick. If an enemy is killed by the Leech, Isaac will be healed by half a heart.*The Leech's healing effect does not affect characters that do not have red heart containers.;Enemies that turn into flesh piles and regenerate when killed such as Globins and some dark red champions regenerate quicker than the Leech can kill them. Isaac will gain half a heart each time the enemies collapse, granting an easy way to regenerate all red hearts. This can also open up many powerful synergies with any item that provides a benefit or resource when Isaac takes damage
ItemRebirth;Lemon Mishap;56;collectibles_056;yellow lemon;When used, a tiny pool of 'Lemonade' will drop on the floor, damaging any enemies that walk over it.*This effect is especially useful against any kind of stationary or slow enemy;Any particular item that impedes enemy movement - Increses the duration enemies are exposed to the damaging puddle
ItemRebirth;Libra;304;collectibles_304;blue;*Gives Isaac 6 Coins, 6 Bombs and 6 Keys.*Continually balances Isaac's primary Attributes - Damage, Range, Tears, and Speed (has no effect on Luck or Shot Speed). This effect is NOT one time only - Libra will rebalance Isaac's attributes whenever they are changed by an item, effect, etc. including temporary effects such as the The Book Of Belial.;The balancing formula for Libra values Damage a little lower than other stats. This means a standard Damage Up effect will actually grant less damage than a standard Speed Up or Range up effect will.*Stats are capped before Libra's balancing is applied. This means that if speed is maxed out (2.0) already, a Speed Up effect will not increase any stats at all.
ItemRebirth;Lil' Brimstone;275;collectibles_275;black;*Spawns a familiar that fires a mini-Brimstone beam. It needs to be charged up it will not fire if Isaac is shooting a steady stream of tears.*Unlike Brimstone, Lil' Brimstone can start charging up a beam while still firing the previous one.;
ItemRebirth;Lil' Haunt;277;collectibles_277;white ghost;A familiar that damages enemies by chasing them as well as inducing the fear effect.;
ItemRebirth;Little Baggy;252;collectibles_252;glass bowl;*Allows Isaac to carry two pills. Tap the Drop button to cycle through the two pills.*Spawns a random pill.*Changes all Tarot card and rune drops into pills.*Any Tarot card or rune held when picking this item up will change into a pill.;
ItemRebirth;Little C.H.A.D.;96;collectibles_096;red worm;Drops half a red heart every two rooms.;Dark Bum - Dark Bum will convert Little C.H.A.D's hearts into soul hearts.
ItemRebirth;Little Chubby;88;collectibles_088;brown worm;*Adds a familiar that follows Isaac.*Little Chubby will charge across the room, following Isaac's first tear, until it hits a wall and then returns to Isaac to recharge.*Little Chubby deals touch damage to any enemies in its path.*The familiars attack is affected by momentum, just as tears are. Thus, it can be shot diagonally.;For Little Chubby to recharge, it must first get back to Isaac. Therefore, running away from Little Chubby after firing it will extend the time required to recharge it.
ItemRebirth;Little Gish;99;collectibles_099;bomb;Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and fires slowing tears.;
ItemRebirth;Little Steven;100;collectibles_100;black kid;pawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and fires homing tears.;Little Steven may be dropped by any Boss, the reason for this is currently unknown as in the original The Binding of Isaac there was an 80% chance that Little Steven could be dropped just by Steven after defeating him.
ItemRebirth;Loki's Horns;87;collectibles_087;horn;*Chance to shoot tears four ways like the boss Lokii can.*Chance depends on the Luck stat, and goes up to 100% at 7 Luck.;
ItemRebirth;Lord of the Pit;82;collectibles_082;cross red;*Grants Isaac Flight.*+0.3 Speed Up (not applied until the next time Isaac's speed stat is updated).;Leo and Thunder Thighs acts as a plausible synergy / anti-synergy as you will no longer be able to hide on top of rocks.
ItemRebirth;Lost Contact;213;collectibles_213;contact silver;*Gives Isaac's tears a shield surrounding them, allowing the player to block enemy shots.*Isaac's shots are destroyed upon contact with an enemy's shot.*-16% Shot Speed.;
ItemRebirth;Lucky Foot;46;collectibles_046;foot;*+1 Luck.*Increases chances of winning at Shell Game Beggar and Fortune Teller (independent of luck stat).;
ItemRebirth;The Ludovico Technique;329;collectibles_329;eye;Instead of firing tears, Isaac controls one floating tear that hovers over obstacles. This tear deals constant damage when held in place over an enemy.;*Ludovico tear movement speed is determined by the Shot Speed stat.*Ludovico tear hits per second are determined by the Tears stat.*When Death uses his The Hourglass attack, the tear is slow to respond but then moves so quickly that it is nearly impossible to use effectively.
ItemRebirth;A Lump of Coal;132;collectibles_132;coal black;Tears gain a flat damage bonus based on how far they travel. This starts at +0 and increases to about +6 at a standard room's width (but can go higher).;
ItemRebirth;Lunch;22;collectibles_022;food brown grey;Grants one red heart container.;
ItemRebirth;Maggy's Bow;312;collectibles_312;pink, bow;*Adds one heart container.*Red Hearts heal double their value. A red half-heart replenishes one red heart of Isaac's health, a red full-heart replenishes two red hearts of Isaac's health, and a 1+1 free heart replenishes four red hearts of Isaac's health.;
ItemRebirth;Magic 8 Ball;194;collectibles_194;8 ball billard;*+16% Shot speed.*Drops a random tarot card on the ground nearby.;
ItemRebirth;Magic Fingers;295;collectibles_295;box;Uses 1 coin to deal a screen-wide damaging attack similar to The Necronomicon that scales based on player damage. Unlike the Necronomicon, however, it has no recharge and can be used repeatedly in the same room.;
ItemRebirth;Magic Mushroom;12;collectibles_012;mushroom;*+1 Health Up.*+0.3 Damage Up.*x1.5 Damage Multiplier.*+5.25 Range Up.*+0.3 Speed Up.*+0.5 Tear Height.*Isaac grows in size.*Fully restores all red heart containers.;*The Magic Mushroom does not give a tears up despite its quote saying 'All Stats Up'.*The x1.5 damage multiplier does not stack with the x1.5 damage multiplier from Cricket's Head or from the combination of The Book Of Belial and Blood Of The Martyr. However, it will stack with any multipliers not listed here.*Despite Isaac's increased size, the size of his hitbox remains the same
ItemRebirth;Magic Scab;253;collectibles_253;scab red;*Grants Isaac a full heart container.*Increases Luck.;
ItemRebirth;Magneto;53;collectibles_053;horseshoe red;*Drops ( e.g. hearts, coins, keys, bombs, etc. ) are attracted to Isaac.*The attraction enables the item to pass/fly over pits or rocks, but not through Key Blocks.*A few enemies (like the Horf) are drawn toward Isaac as well.;
ItemRebirth;The Mark;79;collectibles_079;red;*+1 Damage up.*+0.2 Speed up.*Grants one soul heart.;
ItemRebirth;Match Book;344;collectibles_344;book, grey;*Spawns two or three bomb pickups near Isaac.*Grants Isaac one Black Heart.;*It's advised to pay attention when picking up this item, as it may spawn troll bombs.*Presumably the bomb equivalent to Latch Key.

TrinketRebirth;Daemon's Tail;22;trinket_022;tail black;*All Soul/Eternal/Red Heart drops turn into Black Hearts, if they can.*Elements such as Tinted Rocks, Red Chests, Fortune Tellers, Tarot Cards, Little Chad, Bloody Penny, or Blue Fires can't drop Black Hearts. Thus, they will still drop Soul/Red Hearts with Daemon's Tail.*The drop chances for every kind of heart are reduced.*This means that cleared Rooms, Bosses, Slot Machines, Fortune Tellers, Beggars, Fires, Chests, Red Chests, Poops, Tinted Rocks, Items (Gimpy, Old Bandage, Fanny Pack), Trinkets (Bloody Penny), and Familiars (Little Chad, The Relic, etc) have lower chances of spawning any kind of heart.*Hearts that are present upon entering a room for the first time are unaffected by the reduction (for example, the ones found in Curse/Devil/Angel Rooms), but will have their contents converted to Black Hearts.*The exceptions to this are particular Super Secret Rooms, which have the effect of forcing all heart drops to be the kind found within them.*The V - Hierophant and VI - Lovers Tarot Cards have a chance to drop one heart instead of two. The hearts they drop will not be Black Hearts.*If something can drop pickups other than hearts, instead of dropping hearts it will drop its other possible pickups more frequently.*This means that these things will keep the same chance to drop a consumable, with an increased chance for drops other than hearts, and less chance for heart drops.*In particular, you'll have increased chances for Tarot Cards & Trinkets from Fortune Tellers, Bombs and Keys from Tinted Rocks, Pills and items from Red Chests, and Coins from Poops and Fires, while the rest of the mechanics, like Slot Machines, cleared Rooms, Beggars, Chests, and the Fanny Pack can drop any consumable.;

TrinketRebirth;Liberty Cap;32;trinket_032;cap grey;Grants a chance of triggering one of the following effects for the current room upon entering it:*Mini Mush.*Odd Mushroom (Large).*Odd Mushroom (Thin).*The Compass.;*If the Compass effect triggers while having the Treasure Map, the Compass effect is permanent for the remainder of the floor.
