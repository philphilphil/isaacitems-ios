I learned Swift and CoreData with this project, so there may be some bad code. :)
##Features
Look up the effect of every Item, Trinket, Card and Rune in the game.
Search by name or by a property of the Item. To find "1UP" 
you can search for "green" or "mushroom".
You can create a "Tracker" for a ingame run and add items you collected
and archive the run. All in a beautiful native iOS App. 
##Build
IsaacItems uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/philphilphil/isaacitems-ios.git
cd isaacitems-ios
pod install
```
